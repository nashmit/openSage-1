## openSage: the open source SAGE implementation
This project currently has multiple goals for me
 - Learn OpenGL (this is my first 3D graphics project)
 - Explore Vala use outside of GNOME/GTK environments
 - Provide a cross platform implementation of the SAGE engine, initially based on GLib and SDL + OpenGL
 
## Building
The project is cross platform and has been succesfully built on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
I'm currently using Windows as my development environment so there might be breakage in other platforms until a Continuos Integration service is employed.

----------------
NOTE: If using Windows, make sure to use the msys2 development environment

To compile the project, make sure you have the dependencies installed as listed here:

https://github.com/smx-smx/openSage/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L26

And make sure you have the Vala compiler (valac) installed aswell
